# dijkstra

Implemented dijkstra's algorithm in python to find the shortest path between nodes of a graph.

The program contains two different implementations of the algoritm, the first implementation is O(n^3) and the second implementation is O(n^2).
Both algorithms take the edges and the starting node as the input and out put the shortest path from the starting point.
